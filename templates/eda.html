          <p>Looking at a correlation matrix of all the variables, it is evident that the strongest correlation of charges is smoker versus non-smoker.  The next strongest correlation is age, and the third strongest is BMI. The rest of the variables have a very weak correlation to charges.</p>

          <p>When looking at the feature importances to charges within the model, it is again evident that smoker, BMI, and age are the most influential, but BMI and age have switched places of importance. Children, region, and sex all have a negligable influence, which is also supported by the correlation matrix.</p>

      <p>Charges in the Northeast and Northwest average around the lower end at under $10,000 for non-smokers and $30,000 for smokers. The Southwest falls in the middle with roughly similar costs for non-smokers, but for smokers, costs come out around $32,000. The Southeast's averages for non-smokers is similar again, but with smokers costs at $35,000! Overall, the differences between regions are very small and can probably be explained by other variables, while the differences between smoker and non-smoker are very clear.</p>

      <p>While there doesn't appear to be any great differences between region, it is pretty clear that higher BMIs are linked with higher charges.</p>
